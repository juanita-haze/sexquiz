    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about SpicyQuiz.",
    "q1": "How does SpicyQuiz work?",
    "a1": "SpicyQuiz is a couples quiz that helps you and your partner discover shared desires. You each take the quiz separately, answering honestly about your interests. Then, we compare your answers and only show you the things you BOTH said yes to. This way, neither partner feels embarrassed about desires that aren't mutual.",
    "q2": "Can my partner see my individual answers?",
    "a2": "No! Your individual answers are completely private. Only mutual matches (where both partners said yes) are ever revealed. If you said yes to something but your partner didn't, that information stays hidden forever.",
    "q3": "Is my data private and secure?",
    "a3": "Absolutely. We take privacy very seriously. No account is required, all data is encrypted in transit, and we automatically delete all sensitive information after 90 days. We never share your data with anyone.",
    "q4": "How long does the quiz take?",
    "a4": "The quiz takes about 10 minutes per person. There are 110 questions across 10 categories, covering everything from basics to more adventurous topics.",
    "q5": "Why do I have to pay to see all results?",
    "a5": "We show you a preview of your matches for free. The small fee helps us keep the service running, maintain privacy standards, and continue improving the quiz. It's a one-time payment, not a subscription.",
    "q6": "What if we don't have any matches?",
    "a6": "Don't worry! Having fewer matches in certain categories is completely normal. It doesn't mean anything is wrong with your relationship. The quiz is meant to help you discover new things, not judge your compatibility.",
    "q7": "Can we retake the quiz?",
    "a7": "Yes! You can start a new quiz anytime. People's preferences can change over time, so feel free to retake the quiz periodically to discover new shared interests.",
    "q8": "Is there an age requirement?",
    "a8": "Yes, both partners must be 18 years or older to take the quiz. By starting the quiz, you confirm that you meet this requirement.",
    "q9": "What does the anatomy selection do?",
    "a9": "The anatomy selection helps us customize certain questions to be more relevant to you and your partner. Some questions may be phrased differently based on anatomy for clarity.",
    "q10": "How are 'matches' determined?",
    "a10": "A match occurs when both partners answer 'Sure' or 'Yes!' to the same question. Both of you need to show positive interest for it to count as a match.",
